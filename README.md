Repository for "The Gaming Room" software design

-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a game studio that has a game that currently runs on Android exclusivly and they want to port the game over to a web based platform. The game is not resource demanding like a AAA title game, but still needs to run as expected for the user. 
  
-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I have a decent knowlage base of servers, backend, and Linux and I feel like I made good recomendatons for the web based needs of this game. I also feel that My reccomendations of memory allocation are helpful. 
  
-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I felt like being able to "talk" through my ideas was very helpfull for my own problem solving process. It is something I will carry forward with all projects.
  
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  My knowlage of the interface between the backend and the frontend is lacking. I want to work in this area to make a few of my own projects to get better.
  
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user's needs drives the entire project. Making this game more universally accessable was the goal and as the developer we needed to find a way to do that while keeping the game funcionally the same or better than when it was on Android. Making these changes for the user is important because if the user doesnt like it, they wont be a user anymore. That is a bad buisness model. 
  
-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Designing software needs to come from a concept of first pricniples. Don't be a solution looking for a problem, but diagnose the problem and set a goal based on that information. For this project the problem was making an Android exclusive app into a web based app. The first principles reason for this comes down to "Android users make up x% of the market share, how do we get access to 100%?" and a web based app is the simplest way to do that.
